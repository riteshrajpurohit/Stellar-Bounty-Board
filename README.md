## 📐 Architecture

See the full [Architecture Document](docs/architecture.md) for the system overview, data flow, and transaction lifecycle.

**Quick summary:**
```
User (Freighter) → React App → Supabase (bounties/submissions/payouts)
                             → Stellar Horizon (sign + submit tx)
                             → Immutable TxHash stored in Supabase
```

---

## 🚀 Quickstart: Local Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js ≥ 20.x
- [Freighter Wallet](https://freighter.app) browser extension
- A Supabase project (free tier works)

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/riteshrajpurohit/stellar-bounty-board.git
cd stellar-bounty-board
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

### 3. Initialise Database

In your Supabase SQL editor, run the scripts in order:

```
supabase/schema.sql       ← Creates all tables + RLS policies
```

> The `submissions.sql` file in the repo is the standalone reference. `schema.sql` is the comprehensive reset + create script.

### 4. Fund Your Testnet Wallet

Visit [Stellar Friendbot](https://friendbot.stellar.org/?addr=YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS) to fund your Freighter testnet wallet with 10,000 XLM.

### 5. Run Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

---

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
npm run test
```

**Current test coverage:**
- `bountySchema.test.ts` — 5 tests (valid data, short title, non-positive reward, past deadline, short description)
- `submissionSchema.test.ts` — 3 tests (valid, short notes, empty link)

All tests are deterministic — no network calls, no flakiness.

---

## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions runs on every push/PR to `main`:

```yaml
1. Install dependencies (npm ci)
2. Run linter (eslint)
3. Run unit tests (vitest)
4. Build production bundle (tsc + vite build)
```

View [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml).

## 🌍 Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | ✅ | Your Supabase project URL |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | ✅ | Supabase anon/public key |

> All Stellar config (Horizon URL, network passphrase) is hardcoded to testnet in `src/lib/stellar/payments.ts`.

## 💸 Payment / Transaction Explanation

Stellar Bounty Board uses **direct peer-to-peer payments** on the Stellar testnet (no escrow smart contract):

1. Creator approves a winning submission in the Review Panel
2. Frontend builds an unsigned `Payment` operation using `@stellar/stellar-sdk`
3. XDR is sent to Freighter → user approves in wallet popup
4. Signed XDR is deserialized and submitted to `horizon-testnet.stellar.org`
5. On success: `tx_hash` is stored in `payout_transactions` table in Supabase
6. Bounty status is updated to `awarded`
7. Explorer link with the real `tx_hash` is shown to both parties

**Error handling covers:** insufficient balance, invalid destination, user rejection, network failures, and Horizon-reported result codes.

### Feedback & Iteration Summary

Key feedback and implemented changes are documented in:
- [`docs/validation-report.md`](docs/validation-report.md) — raw feedback per user
- [`docs/iteration-notes.md`](docs/iteration-notes.md) — what we built based on that feedback

**Top 3 improvements from user feedback:**
1. **Mobile layout** — Increased button tap targets and padding
2. **Empty states** — Added clear placeholder UI and CTAs when no bounties exist
3. **Status badges** — Made Open/Awarded/Closed bounty states visually distinct
